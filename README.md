# tradezeroweb-enhancements
A chrome extension to enhance the performance of tradezero web, as well as providing a better user experience.

How to setup:
* Download the extension from github
* Extract the content into a folder
* Open Chrome go to Settings -> More Tools -> Extensions
* Enable "Developer Mode"
* Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you just downloaded from github
* Go to the tradezero free trading tool and reload it [standard.tradezeroweb.com](https://standard.tradezeroweb.co/)

Features so far:
* Allows to collapse PNL section (shows up collapsed by default)
* Clicking on the open positions symbol would add the Qty to the quantities so trading with multiple tickers we can quickly sell/buy.


Note: You are free to use this tool, however I only use this for personal interest. The Tradezero web free tool is good enough, so with this feature I just add a few nits that I am willing to change so I don't have to wait for the next TZ release. This tool does not harm or affect TZ web at all, it is just a Chrome extension, is up to the developer to install any extension he wants in his chrome browser.
